Sowa: They were never able to give a precise defintion of a situation.

? Barwise and Perry (1983):  “A region of space-time.” “Thus we assume that the spatiotemporal relations are    extensional and that there is a fixed fact about the matter about which relations hold of which locations.” 
? Keith Devlin (1991):  Situations “include, but are not equal        to any of, simply-connected regions of space-time, highly         disconnected space-time regions, contexts of utterance...,        collections of background conditions for a constraint, and        so on.

Issues: Tied to space/time
